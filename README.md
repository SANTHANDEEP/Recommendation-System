AN EFFICIENT FRAMEWORK FOR STUDENTâ€™S CLUB  RECOMMENDER SYSTEM USING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS

# Overview
This repository contains the published research paper titled "An Efficient Framework for Studentâ€™s Club Recommender System Using Machine Learning Models", presented at ICICC'24. The paper introduces a machine learning-based Club Recommendation System (CRS) designed to help students find suitable extracurricular clubs based on their interests and academic backgrounds.

# Abstract
The research addresses challenges students face in selecting extracurricular activities by proposing a Factorization Machines (FM)-based recommendation system. By utilizing advanced machine learning techniques such as Collaborative Filtering, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), the system enhances accuracy in club recommendations. The study highlights how optimized data pre-processing and matrix factorization improve personalized recommendations, fostering student engagement in university communities.
